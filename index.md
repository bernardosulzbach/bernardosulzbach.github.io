Hi, I'm Bernardo Sulzbach.
I have several years of experience with many different programming languages, including
- low-level, statically-typed system programming languages, such as C++, Rust, and C;
- high-level, dynamically-typed scripting languages, such as Python and JavaScript;
- pure functional languages such as Haskell;
- languages most commonly used for enterprise software development, such as Java and C#.

I strongly believe in using the right tool for the task at hand, and see most hard rules in technology as obstacles to progress.
Reality is not simple.
I generally agree with most of what
Rich Hickey,
[John Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php), and
Martin Kleppmann
wrote when it comes to how to break down large systems and write software.

Lately, I have been working on the specification and a reference implementation of my first programming language using Rust.
Furthermore, I have also been using C++ to implement real-time soft-body physics simulations.

I'm currently living in Berlin, but I'm willing to relocate for interesting job opportunities.
