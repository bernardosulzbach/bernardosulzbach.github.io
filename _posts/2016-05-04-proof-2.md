# What we are proving

The square root of any prime number p is an irrational number.

# About this proof

This is a quite short and simple proof. I've noticed that proofs for specific
primes seem to be much more popular. However, the proofs are so similar that it
does not even makes sense to prove a specific case instead of the general one.

As one might expect, this is a [proof by reduction to the
impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum).

# The proof

Suppose that √p is a rational number. Therefore there exist two [mutually prime
numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers) a and b such that √p =
a / b.

Therefore, p = a² / b². Then b² p = a², which implies that p divides a², and,
because p is a prime, p divides a. Therefore, b² p = (k² p²), which can be
simplified to b² = k² p. This implies that p divides b², and p divides b, which
is absurd as a and b are mutually prime in our proof.

By reduction to the impossible, this proves that the square root of any prime
number p is an irrational number.
