title: Generating Permutations
---

I have written about algorithms that generate permutations.

There is [this blog post about Heap's algorithm]({{ site.baseurl }}/heaps-algorithm/).

There is also [this post about another algorithm]({{ site.baseurl }}/lexicographic-permutations/).

Lastly, if you need pseudorandom permutations, you can use [Fisher-Yates
shuffling]({{ site.baseurl }}/algorithms/fisher-yates/).
