[Lyrics](http://www.guesssong.com/) is my newest project. It uses
Node.js and MongoDB and is deployed on OpenShift.

Lyrics consists of a web application that shows two lines of a song to the 
player and then waits for him to guess the artist and title of the song.

Albeit conceptually simple, this has a lot of potential. I can see sessions, 
user accounts, rankings, real-time competitive gaming, and what else have you
emerging from this initially very simple idea and couldn't be happier about it.

Also, I've decided not to show any ads on the site. I don't like ads and this 
is not how I would like the internet to be. As I dedicate a lot of time into
developing that website and there may be hosting costs in the near future, I've
provided an easy way for anyone to
[help the project financially](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=EUFZCHLNZU2ZU).

Lastly, I solved some user feedback issues by simple making the [project's
Bitbucket's issue
tracker](https://bitbucket.org/mafagafogigante/guesssong/issues/new) public, so
that I can let players report bugs and give suggestions easily.

Go there and check it out, it is a work in progress but is fully working.

Edit: the links have been updated to GuessSong, but the text was left as it
was.
