This is the first of what may end up being a series of posts regarding the
development of my closed-source game Hellish Bricks.

The game is heavily inspired on Devil Daggers (2016), but intends to focus on
low-poly and minimalist graphics instead of retro ones.

Hellish Bricks is written using modern C++ and requires at least OpenGL 3.3 and
just about 128 MiB of free memory for now.

I intend to write better and more visually appealing shaders in the future and
start working on some fancier graphical effects, such as particles and shadows.

# Playable Demo

[Here is the compiled binary for Windows](https://goo.gl/WfTze5). You need at
least Windows Vista to run the game. You may need to download and install the
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
2017](https://goo.gl/csqCeA) before being able to execute the game.

New versions of Wine are also able to run the abovementioned executable.

In the future I may release Linux, BSD and maybe even macOS demo builds.
