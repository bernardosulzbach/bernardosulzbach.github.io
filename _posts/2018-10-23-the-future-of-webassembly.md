title: The Future of WebAssembly
---

I was happy to read about
[what is planned for WebAssembly](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/10/webassemblys-post-mvp-future/).

It is a really good thing to see what came after `asm.js` going so far. If we
are transpiling to JS anyway, might as well compile to something which runs
faster.

Lastly, I'd like to point out that the author has
[this blog](https://code-cartoons.com/)
which has some other well-made cartoons explaining web concepts.
