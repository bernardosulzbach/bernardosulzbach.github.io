# What we are proving

If n² (n ∈ ℕ) is divisible by a prime p, then n is divisible by p.

# About this post

This is not a complicated proof. However, I wanted to start writing more about
mathematics around here and decided that this was a worth posting. It should
also help me see how well I can write without LaTeX support.

# Specific proof for a prime

Before proving the generalized version for all primes, I am going to prove that
this is valid for a small prime. In this case, I've chosen 3. The easiest way I
could find involved proving the contrapositive.

Let us prove that if n is **not** divisible by 3, n² is also **not** divisible
by 3.

If n is not divisible by 3, n may be written as either n = 3k + 1 or n = 3k + 2.

For the first case, n² = 9k² + 6k + 1 = 3(3k² + 2k) + 1, which is not divisible
by 3.

For the second case, n² = 9k² + 12k + 4 = 3(3k² + 4k + 1) + 1, which is also not
divisible by 3. 

This concludes the proof that if n is **not** divisible by 3, n² is also **not**
divisible by 3, which also proves that if n² (n ∈ ℕ) is divisible by 3, n is
divisible by 3.

# Generalization for all primes

If n² (n ∈ ℕ) is divisible by a prime p, n is divisible by p.

Again, I will prove the contrapositive. If n is **not** divisible by p, n² is
also **not** divisible by p.

If n = pk + q, for a positive q, q < p, then n² = p²k² + 2pkq + q²
Therefore n² = p(pk² + 2kq) + q². As p is a prime, p ∤ q² and therefore n² is
not divisible by p.

This proves that  if n² (n ∈ ℕ) is divisible by a prime p, n is divisible by p.
