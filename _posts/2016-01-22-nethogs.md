This is a very short post to show one of my favorite system monitoring tools:
NetHogs. If you are on a Linux box, it should be fairly easy to get it no
matter what is your Linux distribution.

Once you have it, just run it as root and you will have a minimalistic,
readable, and very useful list of which processes are consuming your bandwidth
and how much of it each process is using.

You can also run it with the `-v1` flag to get the sum of KB instead of the
KB/s rate of each process.
