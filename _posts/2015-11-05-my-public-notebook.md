title: My Public Notebook
---
I have always kept formulas and definitions I had to remember written in text
files (TXT, ODT, etc) on the cloud. Recently I decided that I should group all
these notes in the same place and make them public so that others could also
benefit from them and - why not - even help me extend them.

So I started a public GitHub repository called ``formulas`` (may be renamed to
``notebook`` in the future). It already has a nice level of automation, in the
sense that a single bash script triggers a new GitHub release and will, in a
matter of one or two minutes, result in a new PDF in the repository releases.

I invite you to [check it out](https://github.com/mafagafogigante/formulas)
and, perhaps, open a pull request or give me some tips and suggestions.
