# ACID

+ **A**tomicity
+ **C**onsistency
+ **I**solation
+ **D**urability

ACID is a set of properties that guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably.

# BASE

+ **B**asic **A**vailability
+ **S**oft-state
+ **E**ventual consistency

BASE is an alternative to ACID whose guarantees are much looser than ACID guarantees.
