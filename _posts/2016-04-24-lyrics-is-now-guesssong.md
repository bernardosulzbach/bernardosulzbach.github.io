title: "Lyrics is now GuessSong"
---

After working on Lyrics for some months on the days I found some time for it, I
decided to take it to the next level. I went to Namecheap (my experience with
GoDaddy hasn't been good) and bought myself a domain good enough for it. As one
would assume, lyrics.com was already taken. However, I managed to get
[guesssong.com](http://www.guesssong.com), which makes a pretty decent name for
the game and is not used for anything else already.

DNS changes have already been made and email has been properly set up, so now
you can find GuessSong on [www.guesssong.com](http://www.guesssong.com) and
email me about it at [contact@guesssong.com](mailto:contact@guesssong.com).
