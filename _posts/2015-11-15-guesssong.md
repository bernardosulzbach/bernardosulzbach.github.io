[GuessSong](http://www.guesssong.com/) is my newest project using Node.js and
MongoDB.

It consists of a web application that shows two lines of a song to the player
and then waits for him to guess the artist and title of the song.

In the future it might have sessions, user accounts, rankings, real-time
competitive gaming.

I've decided not to show any ads on the site, as I always do.

Lastly, I made user feedback simple by making the [project's issue
tracker](https://bitbucket.org/mafagafogigante/guesssong/issues/new) public, so
that I can let players report bugs and give suggestions easily.

Go there and check it out, it is a work in progress but it is fully working.
