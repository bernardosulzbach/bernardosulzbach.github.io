title: "Infection"
---

Infection is a sandbox contagion simulator I recently started working on. It
is an entertaining game that anyone with a basic understanding of JavaScript
should be able to hack.

A simple set of rules and values govern how an infection spreads in a square
board of 400 tiles. In the future, different challenges should be made
available.

It is [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/contagium/contagium/) and
released under the MIT license.

You can find an online version of the project
[here](https://contagium.github.io).
