title: What Computer Science Majors Should Know
---

This post is a collection of highlights from [this fantastic
article](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) about what
every computer science major should know by Matt Might.

# Portfolio over Resume

> A resume says nothing of a programmer's ability.

> Every computer science major should build a portfolio.

# Communication

> Modern computer scientists must practice persuasively and clearly
> communicating their ideas to non-programmers.

# Unix

> Given the prevalence of Unix systems, computer scientists today should be
> fluent in basic Unix.

# Programming Languages

> While it is important to teach languages relevant to employers, it is equally
> important that students learn how to teach themselves new languages.

> The best way to learn how to learn programming languages is to learn multiple
> programming languages and programming paradigms.

# Mathematics

> Computer scientists must be fluent in formal mathematical notation, and in
> reasoning rigorously about the basic discrete structures: sets, tuples,
> sequences, functions and power sets.

# User Experience

> Programmers too often write software for other programmers, or worse, for
> themselves.

> User interface design (or more broadly, user experience design) might be the
> most underappreciated aspect of computer science.

# Databases

> It's useful to understand the fundamental data structures and algorithms that
> power a database engine, since programmers often enough reimplement a database
> system within a larger software system.

# There is more

There is much more than this on the original post. It is also supposedly an
alive post, so you should definitely check it out from time to time. There is
also some really nice stuff about which languages the author thinks provide a
reasonable mixture of paradigms and practical applications that I did not quote
because it is fairly long.
