title: "Most Important Things First #2"
---

I wrote I would come back to write about the results of my new approach
to ticking things out of my TODO list. So let us write.

Based on my observations, tackling the most important tasks early on is
really the best way to go through your daily work, but it is awfully
tempting to do some stupid things before the most important ones.
Therefore, albeit hard, **finishing the most relevant chores early on is
the way to go**.

However, I have a bigger issue to solve. My lack of regularity when
going to bed reduces brutally the amount of time I have to invest each
day. I must remember that my lifespan is limited and that I do not have
all the time in the world in order to produce more in my life.
Therefore, for the next week, I am planning to write about doing the
most important things first while also being an early riser.
