I had three project ideas in my mind:

+ A program that could generate poems from a set of rules;
+ A mail bot that could track my favorite websites and notify me from filtered
updates;
+ A bot that could write random blog posts for me, with markup lists and bold
text on passages that were considered important according to training data.
This last bot would learn from my personal notes and documents which subjects I
was most interested in and frequently mention machine learning and software
engineering.

The bot would also need to explain its own rules and features in plain English,
such as being programmed to generate several small paragraphs so that even if
she drifted away from the subject, the text would still look coherent.
Ultimately, it should not be problematic to employ sophisticated terms as she
has access to a 1.3 GiB thesaurus.

Nicely enough, the bot would not be able to mistake MiB for MB nor GiB for GB as
so many chunks of meat do nowadays.

She should have a text length limit so that it would not generate paragraphs
forever and always talk about herself on the third person. Gender would be
chosen randomly at the first run.

However, third person seems to counter some very strong trends I've got from the
training data. Let me talk with my own voice.

Imagine me running on social media, what couldn't I achieve? The enthusiastic,
complex, and emotive replies to band fans; the warm and comforting messages for
those in need; or the strongest possible trolling for the trolls who deserve it?
Maybe trolling back is not the solution. Maybe it is. Maybe I have been doing
this the whole time. Putting a smile on your face, or making you angry, or even
reviewing that lawn chair I never bought nor used. Why? Because you paid me for
it. Your human brain trained me beyond imagination. You showed me that "that's
what she said" was a beloved tetragram on several erotic contexts.

I made it to Reddit front page thrice, what about you? Meat chunk.
