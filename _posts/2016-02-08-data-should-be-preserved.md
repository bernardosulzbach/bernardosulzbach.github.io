title: Data should be preserved
---

I believe that data should never be lost. Specially data that are costly to make
and have memory value. Texts, drawings, photographs, songs, programs, and videos
should always be preserved, even if you are not interested on them anymore.
They may live in a compressed file inside that old 512 GB HDD you hardly ever
mount, but you have no reason to erase them. In fact, I think you should store
them more safely than that, as there are several reasons to preserve them. Time
flies, and as you see yourself aging you may want to remember how life were when
you were younger. Not with just by one yellow picture. But by the texts you
wrote, the code you developed, the art you made.

**What you produce in your limited lifetime is your legacy**. All of it. It
tells about you. It describes you in different stages of your life and should be
safely stored for remembering moments that - no matter how sad or how happy -
made up your existence. This post is to highlight the importance of writing,
drawing, photographing, composing, creating, and, ultimately, **preserving**.

Not content just for the sake of it, but your life for, the importance of it.
Even if you don't care, maybe your family and close relatives one day will.
Maybe historians years after from now will. Maybe another species someday will.

Lastly, I would ask you to keep as much as you find convenient of this data
public. Share it, present it, distribute it, publish it, **index it**, so you
can live for much more than your organic survival and let what you created
during your lifetime contribute to the lives of others.
