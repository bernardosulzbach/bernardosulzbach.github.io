title: Dungeon
---

Dungeon is a text-based open-world role-playing-game. You are in control of the
life of a character that wakes up with a headache and can't remember exactly
what happened to him. You need to do your best to equip yourself to explore
Darrowmere scavenging for powerful and valuable treasure.

You are completely free to explore Darrowmere however you want. Be it slaying
the most terrible creatures, drinking milk directly from cows, or reading books
found in the world to learn about its history and the lives of some of the
Commons (the human-like race of Darrowmere) that lived there. Some books may
even teach your character magical spells that give him some advantage when
dealing with the aberrations roaming the land.

The world is randomly generated, making each and every experience unique. There
is also an in-game wiki with a lot of information about the different facets of
the game. You can preview this wiki
