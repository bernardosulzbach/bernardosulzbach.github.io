title: How I Deal With Spam
---
The struggle is real. Spam is here to stay, but filters have evolved a lot in
the last decade and today automatically deleting 99% (or even more) of all spam
you get is not a dream, but a feasible achievement.

I am a user of Gmail, which is a great mailing system. It gives more than
enough storage space, is very popular - what makes various applications know
how to talk with it -, and even allows for several different options of mail
viewing and filtering. There are some reported privacy issues, though, and
although I care very highly for my privacy - and the privacy of those that talk
with me -, I do not think I would be better off with my own mail server. And
the risk of those new trendy encrypted mailing systems going out from night to
day keeps me away from them.

If I ever need complete safe mail transfer, I'd just encrypt the message,
attach it and then send it through, I would have to tell the receiver the
encryption key somehow, though. Maybe I'd write the message and encrypt it in a
fresh install of a Linux distribution that never touched the Internet. I may
elaborate more on this plan in the future.

Now, back to the point and being very specific to Gmail, what is considered
spam by the Google mail service?

Simple enough, uh? You can only get spam from an address until you report it
as spam.

There is also a machine learning network that collects all these manual spam
reports and makes filters for them, so spam that is reported by a few users
will never make it to the inbox of many others.

This justifies those few email messages that always manage to go through the
filters. But this is a very small price to pay for the convenience of email.

Last but not least, my very nice habit of using `mailto`s to my own address
everywhere does not help much to keep it away from spam senders. And allowing
`who.is` and similar web services to show my email address publicly is not
helping at all either, but I want it to be easily accessible to make
communication with my readers and collaborators as easy as possible. At the end
of the day, dealing with spam is so simple that it goes almost unnoticed.
