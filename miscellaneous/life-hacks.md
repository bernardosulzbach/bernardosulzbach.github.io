title: Life Hacks

This page contains a few small life hacks I like.

As suggested by Randy Pausch in a lecture, keep a "stack" where any
printed documents you think you don't need any longer are sent to. This
way, a no longer desired document stays with you for a few months,
allowing you to recover it if it is necessary. You never now what is
trash and what is not.
