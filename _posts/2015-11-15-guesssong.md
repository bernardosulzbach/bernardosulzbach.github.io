GuessSong is my newest project using Node.js and MongoDB.

It consists of a web application that shows two lines of a song to the player
and then waits for him to guess the artist and title of the song.

I've decided not to show any ads on the site, because I don't like this form of
monetization.

Lastly, I made user feedback simple by making the [project's issue
tracker](https://bitbucket.org/bernardosulzbach/guesssong/issues) public, so
that I can let players report bugs and give suggestions easily.

## Update

As of 2018, I've discontinued to website because I was no longer interested in
the project.
