## Significant figures

### Definition
The significant figures of a number are those digits that carry meaning
contributing to its precision. This includes all digits except all leading zeros
and trailing zeros when they are used to indicate the scale of the number.

## Calculations
The result of addition and subtraction should have as many decimal places as the
term with less decimal places.

The result of multiplication and division should have as many significant
figures as the least precise term.

## Rounding
If the first non-significant figure is a 5 not followed by any other digits or
followed only by zeros, rounding requires a tie-breaking rule.

**Round half up** is the default rounding method used in many disciplines if
the tie-breaking rule is not specified. **Round half to even** rounds to the
nearest even number.

## Set Theory

### Power Set
The power set `P(S)` is the set of all subsets of `S`, including the empty
set and the set `S` itself.

It has `2^n` elements where `n` is the number of elements in `S`.
