# Theory

Scrum is based on empiricism, which is great. Scrum employs an iteratively
incremental approach to increase predictability and control risk. The empirical
process is upheld by three pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

The main reason behind those pillars is the need for flexibility on modern
software development.

# Scrum team

The Scrum team consists of the product owner, the development team, and the
Scrum master.

## The product owner

The product owner, who is a person, not a committee, is responsible for
maximizing the value of the product and the work of the development team.

## The development team

The development team consists of developers who do the work of delivering a
potentially shippable increment at the end of each sprint. Only members of the
development team create the increment. No one tells the team how to turn
product backlog into increments.

**Scrum recognizes no titles for development team members other than
*developer***. Scrum also does not recognize sub-teams in the development
team.

## The Scrum master

The Scrum master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted.

## The sprint

The heart of Scrum is a sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a
potentially potentially product increment is created.

### Sprint review

The sprint review is a time-boxed effort that aims to review and present what
was done in the last sprint.

### Sprint retrospective

The sprint retrospective is also a time-boxed effort. However, it aims to
review the sprint itself, the interactions between team members, and the
productivity of the team.

Although improvements may always be implemented, the sprint retrospective
provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.
