title: Path of Exile calculators
---

I recently developed a web-based [Path of Exile](https://pathofexile.com) calculator so that it is more practical to estimate the number of [divine orbs](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Divine_Orb) required to get at least a certain set of rolls.

It can be found on [its own page](/path-of-exile).

The [JavaScript source code](/assets/path-of-exile/divine-orb-calculator.js) is not obfuscated so it is easier to reuse it if you want to.
